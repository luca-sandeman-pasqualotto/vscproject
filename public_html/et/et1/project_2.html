            The first part of designing this project was thinking of what I
            should make or fix; the only problem was finding something to fix.
            After a lot of struggling, I decided I'd make a small container in
            the shape of a chest from Zelda.

            Remaking the sketch in Fusion was generally easy, with some minor
            problems being designing the decoration in the center of the chest,
            but after getting some help from teachers, I was able to get it all
            working.

            After finishing the sketch, I had to make it all solid which, with
            some minor hiccups when it came to the legs, was overall very easy
            and I was able to finish it very quickly.

            Using a tutorial, I was able to design the hinges in no less than 15
            minutes, the entire process was stupidly simple, and overall I felt
            I had learned the basic principles of hinges in Fusion.

          <figcaption>
            There were some minor hiccups in printing the chest, mostly because
            of the way the bottom of the chest was designed. It required a lot
            of supports that had to be removed once it finished printing.
          </figcaption>

        <figure>
          <img src="img/chest.JPG" alt="chest" />
          <figcaption>
            The chest makes for a very good decoration, it's capable of holding
            small objects and so far, I've been using it to store the cartridges
            for my Nintendo games.

          <figcaption>
            The inside is very spacious, and opening and closing the chest
            provides a lot of entertainment as a fidget toy. Overall, the
            project came together perfectly and I was able to create something
            I'm very proud of.
