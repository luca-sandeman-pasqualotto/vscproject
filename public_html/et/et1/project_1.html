            There was a lot of work that had to be put in to get to the finished
            result, but it all started with the humble sketch of the man
            himself. At first, I couldn't figure out what I wanted to sketch,
            but it all came together when I remembered the meme of the little
            green ball with Sully's face.

          <figcaption>
            The first thing that had to be done was deciding what would
            ultimately represent me. I figured there was nothing better to
            describe me than a meme of Mike Wazowski with Sully's face. So, with
            the idea in my head, the sketch could begin.

          />
          <figcaption>
            The sketch was relatively easy to get done, Mike is basically just a
            big ball with hands and feet, so we could get started on the part
            that would start to get a bit difficult, making this in Fusion.

          <figcaption>
            Once the actual sketch was complete, it was time to recreate it in
            Fusion. I think Mike might've gotten a lot more annoyed when I was
            designing the sketch compared to the actual paper one, but overall
            it was a complete success.
          </figcaption>

        <figure>
          <img src="./img/fusion.png" alt="Mike's completed body" />
          <figcaption>
            After the sketch was done, it was time to figure out how large he
            should actually be. originally, he was going to be around 50-60mm
            tall, but I very quickly realized that if I went through with that,
            I'd have a very thick keychain that probably would've been very
            uncomfortable to carry around, so with some quick adjustments, he
            was soon perfect and ready to print.
