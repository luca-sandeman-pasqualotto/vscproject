            For our final project, I decided to create a small shark toy with a
            moving tail.

            Following the sketch and recreating it in fusion was very easy, I
            planned out all the proportions in advance and it was incredibly
            easy to simply type them in and have it look perfect.

            Making the sketch into a solid was where things got a little bit
            difficult, the biggest struggle I had was trying to smooth out the
            angles, which I realized would be entirely impossible with how I had
            done the sketch. But, I figured it would be better to have a flatter
            toy that would still work than no toy at all.

          <figcaption>
            The hinge proved to be the most difficult part of the model. I had
            to figure out a way to flip the hinges so that the tail would move
            left and right instead of up and down. Once I realized how to make
            the first hinge, the second one was finished in no time and I was on
            my way to printing it.
